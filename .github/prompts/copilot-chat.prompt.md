**Requirements:**
- Follow all conventions, directory structures, coding patterns, and architectural standards in `<laravel-boost-guidelines>`.
- Ensure all responses and code are robust, maintainable, and compatible with Laravel 12 and the projectâ€™s specified dependencies.

- Do not create new documentation files unless the user explicitly requests it.

**Constraints:**
